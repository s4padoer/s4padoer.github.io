This blog intends to provide interesting use cases (beyond the MNIST data set :) and background information about statistical methodology of data science. I am a data scientist and passionate about data and the marvellous things that can be done with it. In order to explore sub-topics in this field and keep myself motivated to do so, I have started this blog and I hope that you enjoy the collection of subjects that I am going to provide.

Please feel free to contact me if you think that there are bugs in the code provided, that I should write about a specific topic or I have made any mistakes in the methodology section.
